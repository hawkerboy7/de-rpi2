# de-rpi2


## What is it?
`de-rpi2` has all files you need to get the a touchscreen working on a raspbery pi 2 B+. It also contains the NodeWebkit linux-arm so you can use NodeWebkit as well.

I did not create any of this but collected it from various sources, since it took me about a week to get everything the way I wanted I put everything online for others to save time.


## How to get it running?
___This will be described soon___
